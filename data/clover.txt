Clover data story
http://www.statlab.uni-heidelberg.de

The purpose of the study was to estimate the effect of the agricultural
weed yarrow, /achillea millefolium/, on the yield of white clover,
/trifolium repens/. It was anticipated that the clover yield would
decrease as teh density of the yarrow increased.
Three areas A,B,C were selected in the clover seed crop. Ten 0.1m^2
quadrats were positioned within each area using random coordinates on a
20x20 grid. In each quadrat the clover seed was harvested and weighted,
and the density of yarrow assessed by counting the number of yarrow
flower stems.
